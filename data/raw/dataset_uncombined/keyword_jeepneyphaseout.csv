Kawawa naman yung jeepney driver.

No. Ang dapat i-phaseout ay yung mga lintik na PUV driver na barubal sa kalsada. Mga jeepney drives, bus drivers, UV Express drivers at taxi drivers na siraulo ang dapat tanggalin.

Do you even ride jeepneys at all? It's not even the vehicle's fault but the driver's. So kahit maging e-jeep yan, kung kamote ang driver this WILL happen.

Tapos ayaw pa din phaseout ang mga lumang jeepney. Yung driver barumbado na tapos yung sasakyan walang kasiguruhan na ligtas ang pasahero. 

Walang kadala-dala ang gobyerno kasi ayaw mawalan ng boto.","2","0","8","0","Sun Apr 13 09:29:26 +0000 2025","0","false","true"
