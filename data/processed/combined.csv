This is further compounded by regressive taxes on fuel such as VAT and excise tax that disproportionately affect the poor while allowing billionaires to benefit from tax breaks. PISTON estimates that jeepney drivers have lost around a total of P6,400 of income due to these oil taxes since the beginning of the year.
